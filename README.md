This project aims to build Linux 0.11 using Microsoft's suite of tools, prioritizing ease of debugging.

The main reasons are:

1. The Linux 0.11 codebase is a protected mode system, ideal for learning protected mode concepts.

2. Currently, most small operating system development and building are done on Linux, providing convenience for those familiar with Windows.

3. Providing a debuggable environment by organizing Linux function addresses based on map information. IDA + Bochs can be used for debugging, locating functions at the level.

4. This is an attempt at developing a small system based on Windows.

It should be noted that most of the code was found online. I have organized and engineered it.

Who invented AT&T assembly? The syntax is simply outrageous. Many people, even those who can understand and write Intel assembly, may not understand AT&T assembly. 
I can understand AT&T assembly, yet I constantly doubt myself. Do you understand it?
